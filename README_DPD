Summary of DPD changes (look for 'DPD edit' inscripts)

- created a farm.z_arr which is array of depths that extends up to z=0
- changed nansum() commands to integration with trapz() --
		--> note this utilizes 2 lines before each integration to manually ignore NaN values

- implemented analytical form of b_per_m array

- other changes are related to above additions, e.g., changing how some arrays are declared in z-index
to be consistent with farm.z_arr sizing
